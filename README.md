# GlaThiDa Ice Thickness Visualization

Interactive Visualization of ice thickness measurements depending on glacier geometry.

Ice thickness observations are taken from [GlaThiDa](https://www.gtn-g.ch/data_catalogue_glathida/).
Glacier geometrical features are calculated using [OGGM](https://oggm.org/).
